# Preparing a New Corpus for Processing  {.unnumbered}

This vignette guides you through preparing and uploading a **new corpus** for analysis in the corpus-tagger interface. Careful preparation of your text files ensures smooth processing and accurate results.

## 1. File Format: Use Plain Text (.txt)

- **All files must be in plain text format** (`.txt`).
- **Do not use word processors** (like Microsoft Word) to save your files, as they add hidden formatting and may not save files as true plain text.
- **Recommended free text editors:**
  - **Mac OS:** [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html)
  - **Windows:** [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- **Why not Word?** Word and similar applications save files in proprietary formats (like `.docx`) that include extra formatting and may not use the correct encoding. This can cause problems during processing.

---

## 2. File Naming: Avoid Spaces, Use Underscores

- **Avoid spaces** in file names. Use underscores (`_`) or hyphens (`-`) instead.
  - Good: `acad_01.txt`, `blog_02.txt`
  - Bad: `my file.txt`, `essay 1.txt`
- **Why?** Spaces and special characters can cause errors during upload and processing.

## 3. Encoding Metadata in File Names (Optional, but Recommended)

- You can **encode category information** at the start of each file name, before an underscore.
- **Example:**
  - `acad_01.txt`, `acad_02.txt` (category: `acad`)
  - `blog_01.txt`, `blog_02.txt` (category: `blog`)
- This allows you to compare up to **20 different categories** in your analysis.
- **Tip:** Keep category names short and consistent.

## 4. Encoding: Make Sure Files Are UTF-8

- **Files must be saved with UTF-8 encoding.**
- UTF-8 is a standard way computers represent text, ensuring all characters are read correctly.
- Most modern text editors (like BBEdit and Sublime Text) save files as UTF-8 by default.
- **How to check?**
  - In BBEdit: When saving, make sure "Encoding" is set to "Unicode (UTF-8)".
  - In Sublime Text: Files are saved as UTF-8 by default.

## 5. Content: Only Include What You Want Counted

- **Be sure that your text files contain only the content you want analyzed.**
- For example, if you are using texts from sources like Project Gutenberg, **remove any headers, footers, or licensing information** that is not part of the original work.  
  - *Example: Project Gutenberg files often include information like "The Project Gutenberg eBook of..." at the top and licensing/legal text at the end. If left in, words like "ebook" or "license" may appear frequently in your results!*
- If your data comes from web pages or other sources, **make sure all HTML or markup tags are removed**. The app cannot distinguish between text and markup, so tags like `<div>`, `<p>`, or `<body>` will be counted as words if present.
- **Tip:** Open your `.txt` files in a plain text editor and review the content before uploading.

## 6. Paragraphs and Formatting

- **No need to preserve paragraph breaks**—these will be removed during processing.
- Just focus on clear, readable text.

---

## 7. Uploading Your Corpus

- Go to the **Load or process a target corpus** page.
- Under **Process a corpus**, select **New**.
- Use the uploader to select and upload your `.txt` files.
- Follow the prompts to process your corpus.
