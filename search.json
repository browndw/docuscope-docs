    "text": "Understanding the Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nKeyness is a statistical measure that compares observed frequencies in two corpora against what we would expect if both corpora were drawn from the same distribution. It helps you identify linguistic features that distinguish your target texts from your reference texts.\n\n\n\nLog-likelihood (LL) - Evidence for an Effect\nLog-likelihood tests how well the observed frequencies match what we would expect if the target and reference corpora were samples from the same underlying distribution.\n\nWhat it calculates: LL = 2×((a×ln(a/E₁)) + (b×ln(b/E₂)))\nWhere a and b are observed frequencies, E₁ and E₂ are expected frequencies\nWhat it tells you: How much evidence there is for a difference between the corpora\nHow to interpret:\n\nHigher LL values = stronger evidence that the corpora differ in their use of this feature\nLL ≥ 3.84 = statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05)\nLL ≥ 6.63 = statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01)\nLL ≥ 10.83 = statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001)\n\nImportant: This is a measure of evidence for an effect, not the size of the effect\nThis app only shows results with p &lt; 0.01 (LL ≥ 6.63)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nImportant caveat: Because log-likelihood measures the amount of evidence for an effect, very frequent words like “the” may show statistical significance even when the actual difference is small (low log-ratio). Conversely, rare words might not reach significance even with large proportional differences because there isn’t enough evidence. This is why you need both measures!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor beginners: Think of log-likelihood as asking “How confident can we be that these corpora really do use this word/tag differently?” Higher numbers mean more confidence.\n\n\nLearn more: Log-likelihood calculator and explanation\n\n\nLog-ratio (LR) - Magnitude of the Effect\nLog-ratio measures how much more frequent a feature is in one corpus compared to another.\n\nWhat it tells you: The magnitude (size) of the frequency difference\nHow to interpret:\n\nLog-ratio of 1 = feature is 2× more frequent in target corpus\nLog-ratio of 2 = feature is 4× more frequent in target corpus\n\nLog-ratio of -1 = feature is 2× more frequent in reference corpus\nLog-ratio of 0 = equal frequency in both corpora\n\nWhy it matters: You can have strong evidence for an effect (high LL) but a small effect size (low LR), or vice versa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nKey insight: Use both statistics together! Log-likelihood tells you how much evidence you have for a difference, and log-ratio tells you how large that difference is. Strong keywords have both high LL and meaningful LR values.\n\n\nLearn more: Understanding effect sizes in corpus linguistics",

The strongest keywords in the target corpus were technical terms like “methodology” (LL = 28.7, LR = 2.1) and “analysis” (LL = 19.3, LR = 1.4), while the reference corpus was characterized by personal pronouns such as “I” (LL = 45.2, LR = -1.8) and “my” (LL = 22.1, LR = -1.5).\n\n\n\nReporting Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBest practices for academic writing:\n\nAlways report both statistics: LL shows evidence strength, LR shows effect size\nInclude significance levels: Use p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, or p &lt; 0.001\nInterpret the direction: Specify which corpus shows higher frequency\nProvide context: Convert LR to fold-change (2^LR) for clarity\nBe selective: Focus on the most meaningful differences, not every significant result\nRound appropriately: LL to 2 decimal places, LR to 2-3 decimal places\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBest practices for academic writing:\n\nAlways report both statistics: LL shows evidence strength, LR shows effect size\nInclude significance levels: Use p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, or p &lt; 0.001\nInterpret the direction: Specify which corpus shows higher frequency\nBe selective: Focus on the most meaningful differences, not every significant result\nRound appropriately: LL to 2 decimal places, log-ratio to 2-3 decimal places",

Enter a Node Word\n\nIn the sidebar, enter the word you want to explore (the “node word”).\nYou can optionally anchor your search to a specific tag (POS or DocuScope) for the node word.\n\n\n\n2. Set the Span\n\nChoose how many words to the left and right of the node word to include in your search window.\n\n\n\n3. Choose an Association Statistic\n\nPMI (Pointwise Mutual Information): Measures how much more often two words appear together than would be expected by chance. It is very sensitive to rare co-occurrences, which can sometimes highlight spurious associations.\nPMI2 / PMI3: Variations of PMI that are less sensitive to rare co-occurrences. These provide more stable results by reducing the influence of very infrequent pairs.\nNPMI (Normalized PMI): Scales PMI between -1 and 1, making it easier to compare across different word pairs and reducing the impact of rare events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTip:\nIf you want to avoid results dominated by rare word pairs, try PMI2, PMI3, or NPMI instead of standard PMI.\n\n\n\n\n4. (Optional) Anchor by Tag\n\nYou can restrict your search to node words with a specific POS or DocuScope tag.\nFor POS, you can choose between general or specific tags.\n\n\n\n5. Generate and Filter Results\n\nClick the Collocations button to generate your table.\nFilter the results by tag using the multiselect box above the table.\n\n\n\n6. Download Your Results\n\nToggle Download to Excel? in the sidebar to enable download.\nClick Download to Excel to save your results.\n\n\n\n7.

    "text": "Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. Select Data\n\nUse the Select corpus radio buttons to choose which data to plot (Target, Reference, Keywords, or Grouped).\nUse the Select data to plot dropdown to pick a specific table (e.g., tag frequencies, document-term matrix).\nPreview your data in the main panel. You can toggle Pivot Table or Make Percent to adjust the format.\n\n\n\n2. Choose a Plotting Library\n\nSelect from plotly.express, matplotlib, or seaborn.\nThe library you choose will affect the style and features of your plot.\n\n\n\n3. Describe Your Plot\n\nUse the chat input at the bottom to describe the plot you want. For example:\n\n“Show a bar chart of the top 10 tags.”\n“Plot a scatterplot of noun vs. verb frequency, colored by group.”\n“Make a boxplot comparing tag frequencies across categories.”\n\nPlotbot will generate the code, run it, and display the plot.\n\n\n\n4. Refine Your Plot\n\nIf you want to change something, just describe the update in the chat. For example:\n\n“Change the color scheme.”\n“Add axis labels.”\n“Show only documents from group A.”\n\nPlotbot remembers your previous messages and builds on them, so you can iterate until you’re satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTip:\nBe as specific as you like! You can ask for titles, legends, color changes, or even new plot types. If Plotbot doesn’t get it right, clarify your request or start over.\n\n\n\n\n5. Download Your Plot\n\nEach plot is shown as a static PNG image.\nUse the Download PNG link below the plot to save it.\n\n\n\n6. Manage API Keys and Quotas\n\nIf you’re using the community API, you have a daily quota of queries. The sidebar shows your usage and remaining queries.\nIf you run out, or want to use your own OpenAI API key, enter it in the sidebar.\n\n\n\n7. Clear Chat History\n\nUse the Clear chat history button in the sidebar to start a new conversation with Plotbot. This can help if your thread gets off track.",

    "text": "Under construction.\nThe Common Dictionary contains eight primary categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nActors\nActors describe the topical focus of a text or its “aboutness”. As the metaphor of “actors” suggests, this category accounts for who or what occupies the stage in a text. Of course, in a longer text, a writer will bring a variety of actors on and off the stage, as topics shift from one to another. However, a text’s goals and audience will shape the overall composition of a cast. Consider, for example, how the Actors in an ecomomics paper, a literary analysis paper and an economics paper might be balanced somewhat differently.\n\n\nCitation\nCitation categories relate to the ways in which writers attribute assertions, claims or messages to other sources. Those attributions can assign more authority to a source (e.g., ‘the report shows…’) or open up space for alternative conclusions (e.g., ‘the report suggests…’).\n\n\nConfidence\nConfidence language signals a writer’s attitude toward statements and claims. Think for example about the difference between “it is clear…” versus “it is possible…”. The first signals a greater degree of certainty while the latter acknoweldges the potential for alternative interpretations. Note that niether makes the assertion any more or less objective or factual. In fact, most writing requires us to constantly evaluate and modulate our expressions of confidence.\n\n\nOrganization\nOrganization refers to the ways in which writers link phrases, sentences, events and claims. Two types of Organization are highlighted: Narrative and Reasoning. We tend to associate Narrative with the telling of stories, particularly in fiction. However, Narrative is also used in academic and professional writing, as well. Think, for example, about how we might organize a lab report or parts of a Methods section. We would likely need to report a clear sequence of events, which would require Narrative.\n\n\nPlanning\nThe language of planning points forward and can orient readers toward future states or goals.\n\n\nSentiment\nThe emotional or affective content of a piece of writing is often measured by Sentiment. Is that emotional content largely postive? Or negative?\n\n\nSignposting\nSignposts are words or phrases that help readers navigate a text, marking structure, transitions or the carrying out of expected rheorical functions (like the posing of a research question, for example).\n\n\nStance\nStance is related to the “voice” or “tone” of a text and signals writers’ commitments and judgments. Stance can encompass a wide range of features, but these categories focus on the ways in which writers can advertise a more assertive or emphatic stance, and the ways they pull back and moderate their stance.\n\n\n\nThe specific tags are then organized into that basic taxonomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTag\nDescription\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nActors: Abstractions\nAbstract Actors are more common when communicating to a specialist rather than a general audience. This kind of language can invoke disciplinary specialization or general abstraction, including words with Greek or Latinate suffixes like -logy, -graph, -ability, -esia, -ization (e.g., ‘sociology’; ‘polygraph’; ‘adoptability’; ‘kinesia’) but also words that are conceptual (e.g., ‘automate’; ‘factor’; ‘paradigm’).\nmodel, information, level\n\n\nActors: First Person\nFirst Person is active when we forground ourselves, often using pronouns like ‘I’ or ‘we’. First Person Actors are more frequent in interactive contexts like speech and texting, but First Person Actors serve imporant functions in academic writing, as well.\nI, our, we are\n\n\nActors: People\nWhen People are prioritized as Actors, communication foregrounds characters, groups (e.g., ‘women’, ‘men’, ‘children’, ‘teenagers’), individuals and particular communities.\npeople, individuals, she\n\n\nActors: Public Entities\nWhen Actors are Public Entities, they reference concepts from public language, media, the language of authority, institutions, and responsibility.\nnational, society, government\n\n\nCitation: Authority\nAuthoritative Citation language aligns your text with your source. It advocates a speaker’s or an author’s point of view and reinforces the authority of that point of view. That authority might be located in an external source; however, it might also be assigned to the results or findings of study.\nfound that, shows that\n\n\nCitation: Controversy\nControversy Citation language acknowledges the source is part of a controversy and may not share the full story.\nargues that, claims\n\n\nCitation: Neutral\nNeutral Citation language focuses on the “facts” the source provides rather than investigating its value or persuasiveness. It can be seen as a dispassionate kind of relationship to a source.\naccording to, discussed\n\n\nConfidence: Hedged\nHedged Confidence language signals moderate or flexible certainty and openness to other points of view.\ncan be, may be\n\n\nConfidence: High\nHigh confidence language signals high certainty that would withstand intense debate.\nit is, clearly\n\n\nOrganization: Narrative\nNarrative is used most often to organize events by time (e.g., ‘before’; ‘after’), but can also be used to sequence them (e.g., ‘first of all’; ‘finally’).\nduring the, after\n\n\nOrganization: Reasoning\nReasoning directs readers from statement to statement by either opening up inferences or blocking inferences. This language can be constructive, meaning that it can connect ideas to form new pathways (e.g., therefore; it stands to reason that). It can also give possible pathways that depend upon contingencies (e.g., ‘if this happens, then that can happen’; ‘most likely’). Reasoning language can also shut down new pathways by drawing clearly oppositional lines (e.g., ‘it is not the case that’; ‘refute’; ‘deny’).\nresults, analysis\n\n\nPlanning: Future\nReferencing future actions, states, or desires.\nwill, proposed\n\n\nPlanning: Strategy\nThis dimension is active when the text structures activism, advantage-seeking, game-playing cognition, plans and goal-seeking.\ndesign, decision\n\n\nSentiment: Negative\nReferencing dimensions of negativity, including negative acts, emotions, relations, and values.\ncorrupted, confrontation\n\n\nSentiment: Positive\nReferences positive across a variety of dimensions, including actions, emotions, relations, and values.\nhealth, opportunity\n\n\nSignposting: Academic Writing Moves\nAcademic Writing Moves are typically associated with STEM-oriented research literature. They can refer to how the research was conducted (i.e., how the writer collected and analyzed data). They can also signal results at a descriptive level, as well as analyze and interpret the meaning and overall significance of the reported findings.\nthis study, method of\n\n\nSignposting: Metadiscourse\nMetadiscourse functions as traffic signs, orienting and directing readers and can include references to oneself as a writer (e.g., ‘I argue’), the audience (e.g., ‘we can see that’), or the writing itself (e.g., ‘in this paper’).\nor, however\n\n\nStance: Emphatic\nAn emphatic stance shows a higher level of force and stronger commitments, judgments or engagements.\nvery, actually\n\n\nStance: Moderated\nA moderated stance shows a less intense level of commitment or force, judgments or engagements.\nslightly, partially",

    "section": "1. Historical and theoretical challenge: Understanding rhetorical language production",
    "text": "1. Historical and theoretical challenge: Understanding rhetorical language production\nThe DocuScope project began as a response to theoretical gaps in the history of the rhetorical tradition. From its roots in western antiquity, rhetoricians have been the language experts seeking to understand how the pragmatic uses of language fashions experiences for other minds – experiences ranging from the novelist’s mise-en-scène (e.g., “the servant paged through a hardbound first edition of Harry Potter on a chocolate swivel chair under a halogen light”) to the invocation of abstractions like publics (“We the people”) and the norms regulating them. Rhetoricians as analysts or educators theorize about “production” knowledge, specifically the knowledge that underlies how culturally-situated speakers and writers manage to refine (or fail to refine) their thoughts into adaptive, timely, effective, and sometimes even inventive expression.\nAccording to rhetorical historian George Kennedy (1963), the rhetorical tradition from classical Greece offered three paths for explaining how production knowledge is acquired and honed. The first path was natural talent or genius, which rhetorical pedagogues acknowledged but did not focus on further. The second path was through a system of “topics” or “topical schemes”, an inventory of abstract categories a speaker could run through as a checklist when contextualizing arguments (syllogisms and enthymemes) for particular situations. Topics could be general to all situations of rhetoric or specialized to particular occasions. For example, for policy speakers of his day, Aristotle [1359b] proposed five topics to consider for relevance: “ways and means, war and peace, national defence, imports and exports, and legislation”. He goes on to elaborate what policy speakers should be prepared to know under each of these topics. Through their very abstractness, topical systems were designed to be comprehensive, helping the student “discover the means of coming as near such success as the circumstances of each particular case allow” [1355b]. However, topics remained practically silent on how a speaker’s narrowing in on one or another topical choice materialized into linguistic choice. In Aristotle’s compartmentalized way of thinking, linguistic choices belonged to a separate art translated as “style”, which Aristotle addressed in a different part of his Rhetoric. Style was relegated to not “what” was said but with “saying it the right way” [1404a]. Language and language variation are distanced from invention and content. Roman rhetoricians from Cicero to Quintilian institutionalized Aristotle’s compartmentalization by making invention and style separate and non-interactive “canons” of rhetoric (Kennedy, 1972/2008).\nThe third path classical rhetoric offered for developing production knowledge, according to Kennedy (1963), was imitation, the close study of the language of specific orators and authors, not only to mimic their craft but to extend it, to generalize from it, and, in the ideal, to learn over time to appropriate it into a craft of one’s own. Through their very concreteness, imitative models afforded a rich fish-eye view of linguistic variation from a specific sample of speakers and writers. Yet imitative models are challenged on issues of representativeness and generalizability. How representative of rhetorical situations was the language being studied for imitation versus all the imitation-worthy language left unexamined? And what in any case ensures that imitation can generalize from “servile copying” (Gruber, 1977) to creativity? If topical systems fell short of anchoring thought in language, imitative models provide no guarantee that the imitator is able to extract the higher-level decision-making that creative imitation sought to uncover.\nIn the mid-1990s, Kaufer and his colleagues began to postulate that adequate theoretical accounts of a speaker or writer’s production knowledge required transparent and bi-directional pathways from thought to expression, and this meant, from the point of view of the rhetorical tradition, a principled merger of the heretofore siloed canons of invention and style. Kaufer and Butler sought a beachhead for this theoretical merger in the Lincoln/Douglas debates (1996). During those debates, Lincoln and Douglas harbor competing rhetorical strategies to support their versions of the American future (an America with Slavery in the case of Douglas; an America without it in the case of Lincoln). Kaufer and Butler found that those competing strategies get implemented in the language of each of their speeches during the debates. They found that each debater’s language often served a variety of affirmative and negative inventional functions characteristic of debate. Some of their language, for example, was designed affirmatively to advance the speaker’s strategy; some was designed to block the opponent’s strategy; some was designed to fend off the opponent’s attacks; and some was designed to double-down on the attack when the opponent’s defense had proven porous.\nIn addition to classifying the debaters’ language and its inventional relevance for debate, Kaufer and Butler found that Lincoln and Douglas relied on inventional strategies involving register. Strategies of this type invoke contexts, which in turn invoke premises, inferences, role identities, and role-appropriate ways of speaking that political debaters can use for legitimation and delegitimation. Douglas in particular tried to entrap Lincoln in a political loyalty register. In the first debate at Ottawa, Douglas hammered home that the Republicans were the new party demanding immediate abolition and Lincoln, as a Republican stalwart, had to be committed to that same (then unpopular in Southern Illinois) platform. In the second debate at Freeport, Lincoln escaped the trap by shifting register and declaring that, though a Republican, he did not agree with his Republican colleagues who demanded the immediate elimination of slavery. Lincoln dodged Douglas’ attack by invoking a register of personal conscience, a register that did not require him to hew to every talking point of the most vocal members of his party. Beyond the tension between party loyalist and personal conscience registers, Kaufer and Butler found tensions between political and personal registers in the debates, between talking as an ideologue and talking as a human being. For example, in the Ottawa debate, after launching a scathing political attack that Lincoln had conspired to “dissolve and kill the old Whig party,” and turn the Whigs into an “Abolition party”, Douglas abruptly shifted gears into a personal/autobiographical register of praise for Lincoln as a “gentleman”: “I mean nothing personally disrespectful or unkind to that gentleman. I have known him for nearly twenty-five years. There were many points of sympathy between us when we first got acquainted.” Douglas continues in this personal register for a few more sentences to show that whatever his differences with Lincoln, they were not personal. Making sense of Douglas’ sudden swivel from an ideological to a personal register requires understanding that by delving into a seemingly friendly register (establishing Lincoln the likeable human being), Douglas was in fact seeking to bolster the credibility of his political register (Lincoln the wrong-headed politician). He needed a personal/autobiographical register to show that his political stance had been scoured clean of personal animus.\nStudying these debates gave Kaufer and Butler (2000) a method for tracking the coordination of inventional strategies and registers with concrete utterances. They went on to scale this tracking method to written genres and to see if they could build a pedagogy indicating how genre variation grew out of systematic variations in composing decisions. Kaufer and Butler (2000) observed that standard pedagogies of language and writing acknowledged the importance of the grammatical relations (words, phrases, clauses) that hold a sentence together (Hopper, 1999), of the coherence relations (Vande Kopple, 1989) across sentences that hold a paragraph together, and the situational constraints that qualify multi-paragraph/multi-section language to be “fitting” (Bitzer, 1968) to its context and genre appropriate (Miller, 1984; Swales, 1990). They argued that a middle layer between grammar and genre that connects invention to the performative sequencing of visible or audible language was largely unexplored. For instance, the sequence “I often used to” violates grammatical phrase boundaries and doesn’t exist as a grammatical unit. Yet it is a vital production unit or as Chafe called it a “intonation unit” (Chafe, 1994), a unit dependent on the limitations of real-time language production. English affords countless variations on this sequence to produce a first-person autobiographical effect, an effect invoking the continuous past of the author or a character (real or imagined) the author is referencing from a first-person vantage. This class of sequences, accumulating in a very large number of options owing to the combinatorics, supports a variety of genres (personal, literary, argumentative) where writers have the latitude to throw autobiographical elements into the mix.\nThe scope of this observation extends beyond autobiography. Language is rife with non-grammatical (and grammatical) sequences that constitute performative phrasing or what we came simply to refer to as composing patterns. The presence or absence of these patterns in a given text determines whether the text is designed (and perceived) as autobiographical or descriptive; whether it creates a linear flow of temporal events meant (and designed to be processed) as story; or hierarchies of concepts meant (and understood) as an information repository; whether it conveys positive or negative sentiment or a perceived infusion of both; whether it is meant (experienced as) subjective or objective, disclosive, facilitative, proscriptive, prescriptive, confident, hedged, cautionary, optimistic, reluctant or resistant; and whether it comes with a register “sounding” academic, public, personal, or even intimate.\nKaufer and Butler (2000) merely peeked into this hidden reservoir of composing patterns as evidence for the book’s larger argument that systematic variations across composing patterns supports the diversity of English written genres. But it was well beyond the scope of that single pedagogical project to turn that postulated reservoir of patterns into a repository that could be tested on actual linguistic data. Creating that repository required constructing a large dictionary of composing patterns.\nAt this juncture, in 1998, we (Kaufer and Ishizaki) began to collaborate on the challenge of developing a theory of rhetorical production with a dictionary of composing patterns tied to invention to support it. We knew such a dictionary could not be curated for scalability without significant computational support. We designed an interactive tagging, visualization, and authoring environment, now known as DocuScope, for classifying language patterns (e.g., “I often used to” and its variations) according to the (designed) reader experience they align with. We developed a suite of automated tools to help keep the dictionary well-organized even as it scaled to millions of patterns.\nClassifying phrases with rhetorical categories requires human interpretation, but we thought of it as “light” interpretation – interpretation that stays close to uncontested cultural understandings (and tagged as contested when composing patterns were interpretatively contested). The DocuScope dictionary was designed to include word sequences of any length, but the majority of sequences are between three and five words. The dictionary can be used to tag individual texts or textual corpora. The current dictionary has been constructed over decades using a digital authoring tool. On a near daily basis, we have added new composing patterns to the dictionary, culled from corpus study but also from reading and listening in face-to-face and mediated contexts. As we add composing patterns to the dictionary, we classify them for rhetorical function and inventional likelihood. The process has been inductive and based on the simple principle that the more patterns that are added to the dictionary from the largest variation of texts, genres, and contexts, the more accurate the dictionary (applied as an automatic tagger) will be in tagging texts not yet inspected.\nIt initially took three years of iterating over thousands of words extracted from corpus study and close everyday reading/listening to produce a taxonomy that could statistically classify the fifteen genres of the Brown Corpus of Written American English and the Freiburg-Brown Corpus of Written English about as well as the human classifiers who originally built it (Collins, 2003). The promise of this study led us to publish Kaufer, Ishizaki, Collins, and Butler (2004), which presented a snapshot of our compendium of rhetorically categorized language. The dictionary presented in that book covered English with statistical robustness but was still proportionally small. It contained only 13,000 individual words and many more sequences of two to six words. This led us to manually work through the 100,000 most frequent words (A-Z) of English, along with idioms in which they participate, to understand how they fit into our existing classification system and how our system required further refinement at the margins to account for the various subtle pragmatic variations that fell in the cracks of our original formulation.\nOver the years, we have experimented with the DocuScope dictionary in support of published research in rhetorical corpus analysis (e.g., Kaufer & Hariman, 2009; Al-Malki et al., 2012). During these years of experimentation (which continue to the present day), we have taken many steps to extend the dictionary’s utility as a corpus and educational tool. The steps taken between 2004 and 2011 are detailed in Ishizaki & Kaufer (2011). The DocuScope repository developed from 2003–2014 became grist for researchers beyond rhetoric proper, by Shakespearean researchers (Hope & Witmore, 2004, 2010), researchers at the Stanford Literary Lab (Allison, Heuser, Jockers, Moretti, & Witmore, 2011), the Rand Corporation, where the repository were incorporated into a Rand in-house tool for analysts (Marcellino, 2020), and the Educational Testing Service where researchers used the repository to devise new methods for measuring validity in argument writing (Beigman Klebanov et al., 2020).\nThe DocuScope dictionary has greatly expanded and refined from 2014 to the present but the overall organizing frame has remained pretty much intact. That frame crosses three primary continua.\n\nInteriority/Externality. Ranges from language seeking to capture mental interiority/individuality/idiosyncrasy to language about an external public world.\nStories/Information. Ranges from language presenting as “story” (temporal organization) to “information” (hierarchical organization).\nMonologic/Dialogic. Ranges from language where the receiver is offstage and unacknowledged to onstage and acknowledged.\n\nTable 1 briefly describes the overarching DocuScope categories as of February 2022, the areas on the various continua they support if not outright favor, and the various managed impressions they help create for a text. Column 1 of the table indicates the dictionary category. Column 2 offers a brief description of the category. Column 3 indicates where the category typically lies on the three continua. Poles of each continuum associated with the category are in bold type. Notice that it is not uncommon for a category to span both poles of a continuum.\nTable 1.

The many students and external researchers the dictionary has supported offers some measure of empirical validation that a hidden middle layer – a rhetorical production layer – that Kaufer and Butler first identified does seem to exist and that it offers some explanatory power in identifying the rhetorical choices underlying a text. It is worth noting, however, that we see the dictionary as an approximation, not a strict implementation, of the theory. The dictionary is not perfect nor will it ever be. This is not only because of the size of the composing patterns needed to cover English but because of the context-dependence of the patterns that pose significant challenges for human curation.\nPolysemous (Ceccarelli, 1998) properties of composing patterns have particularly made their curation within rhetorical categories challenging. By polysemous, we mean the tendency of word meanings to adapt in the direction of the words neighboring them and the external contexts mediating them. Polysemy is an umbrella term. We now turn to four specific types of polysemy that we have discovered and have learned to accommodate in our curation efforts.\n\nthe polysemy of small variation\nthe polysemy of varying pattern length\nthe polysemy of variation around a stable meaning or theme\nthe polysemy inherent in assigning salience to a pattern\n\nThe polysemy of small variation means that a slight change in a pattern can cause significant change in its classification as an inventional resource. Consider the inventional consequences of changing the preposition from swearing at someone to swearing by them to swearing to them. “Smearing a cream” and “smearing a politician” are identical grammatical patterns with respect to both grammatical form and function. Yet one is a motion and the other a slander. The polysemy of small variation has taught us that grammatical similarity and lexical overlap are not reliable signals of inventional potential.\nThe polysemy of varying pattern length means that our classification of a pattern can dramatically change simply by stretching or shrinking it even slightly. A well-known case is fronting a pattern with negation. The English word “surprise” is conventionally defined as an “unusual or unexpected event”, a story twist not (fully) anticipated, something that can leave an audience “surprised”, “astounded”, “astonished” and a British audience “gobsmacked.” But fronting with a negative (“no surprise”) brings major changes in inventional potential. It means that the event could be predicted but more importantly that its present predictability reinforces a confident history of past predictions. If it’s “no surprise” that Joe cleaned the plate of ice cream today, it is because he does so on most any day when the opportunity presents itself. Our curation efforts require close attention to negative patterns on the left.\nLengthening on the right has certain predictable properties we have tried to accommodate. Longer patterns are rarer and soak up more context than shorter ones. As a result, from the start of the DocuScope project, we engineered DocuScope’s parser to match the longest pattern available in its dictionary (Ishizaki & Kaufer, 2011). Consider the 8-word sequence “they doubt they know what they are doing”. The DocuScope dictionary classifies this sequence as an expression of uncertainty. But it classifies its 6-word subsequence “they know what they are doing” as confidence. Faced with the 8-word sequence beginning with “they doubt…”, the DocuScope would thus ignore the 6-word match and match the 8-word, which is more contextually accurate (Ishizaki & Kaufer, 2011).\nThe polysemy of variation around a stable meaning or theme captures the key idea in Erasmus’ (1512/1978) 1512 best-selling Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style. Erasmus treated this type of polysemy (the ability to say essentially the same thing in dozens of different ways) as a feature not a bug of invention. The idea of stylistic copiousness/abundance explains how rhetorical artists can take a meaning or theme and slice it razor thin, each slice with its own unique take. Let us return to “surprise” as a theme to vary. Novelists convey “surprise” in the description of facial expressions. There are “looks of surprise” and “surprised looks”, and “surprised faces”. As an attribute of the face, “surprise” activates synonyms like “agape”, “open-mouthed”, “dumbstruck”, “wide-eyed” and “their jaws dropped”. “Surprise” activates still other pragmatic word families when we shift from a single reaction in time or space to an ongoing state where an audience member has been trained to expect the unexpected. Here “surprise” activates concepts associated with suspense: “suspenseful”, “cliffhanger”, “gripping”, “squeaker”, “edge of the seat”. Should the revealed surprise induce a powerful negative reaction, a whole new class of synonyms activate: “startling”, “kicker” and (if the perceiver is unusually blind-sided) “shocking”, “rude awakening”, “without warning”, and “didn’t see it coming”. Notice that, across all these patterns, the core meaning of “surprise” has not been overturned. But each variation captures a modification that merits distinct inventional credit. This means “dumbstruck” attaches descriptively to a surprised face while “edge of the seat” captures narrative suspense. The polysemy of stylistic abundance, which we take seriously in our curation efforts, entails that, for the rhetorical artist, words are not primitives but divisible “shadings” with adjustable lenses and framings. It is this form of polysemy that marries our theory of invention to the ancient understanding of style (“how you say it”).\nThe polysemy of assigning salience deals with the fact that in multi-word patterns the question arises as to which word(s) gets the focus (salience) and which are there at the periphery to support the focus. For noun phrases, our simple rule of thumb has been “all things equal, trust that the head noun carries the salience.” The application of this rule means that in phrases like “blue wall”, “wall” carries the salience. Color would seem the more incidental (i.e. non-salient) element in most circulation paths of this string. However, the head noun rule can be overridden in many contexts. Take the phrase “collapsed wall”. Is it serving the inventional aims of discussing a wall (descriptive) or a collapse (negative)? In cases like this, we assess that the head noun rule needs to be overridden because “collapsed” is a much rarer (and thus information-rich and so salient) element in the context. The easiest decisions arise when the modifier and the head noun reinforce the salience of the other, making the salience of the phrase “resonant” (judged positively) or “redundant” (judged negatively). An example is “harrowing nightmare.” There’s little loss in salience whether this string gets classified as a “harrowing thing” or a type of “nightmare.” Both modifier and head contribute to the salient meaning of emotional fear.\nThe hardest categorization decisions arise when the salience from both ends seems of equal weight and tugging in opposite directions: “Instructive nightmare.” Suppose we have already classified “nightmarish things” as a source of emotional fear, a negative emotion. Suppose we have already classified “instructive things” as a positive value with potential cross-over to (positive) facilitation and even (positive) inquiry. “Instructive nightmare” defies all previous classifications. Cases of this variety inform us that our current classification system has failed to account for pragmatic sub-varieties in the language we had not anticipated. Even so-called bad things can have constructive sides. In cases such as these, we had to refine our system to accommodate the hybrid concept of a “constructive fear.”\nWe have seen how modifiers can override the salience of head nouns, but head nouns can also override the salience of modifiers. Take the modifier “breathtaking.” If you consult the one billion-word Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA; Davies, 2008), you will find that “breathtaking” is a reliable indicator of positive/inspirational sights and experiences. The most frequent nouns modified are “view”, “beauty”, “speed”, “scenery”, “vistas”, “images”, and “places”. The word “breathtaking” (having one’s breath suspended) appears to have monopolized the conveyance of positive experience in English. The monopoly seems curious because as anyone who has had their wind knocked out, taken food down their windpipe, experienced anxiety, or suffered a heart attack well knows, the suspension of breath is anything but a positive experience. What the positive and negative side of losing breath share is a sense of awe, as Google’s on-line dictionary puts it, “a feeling of reverential respect mixed with fear or wonder.” Our breath commands reverence and that leaves space for a positive sublime side (of wonder/positive inquiry) when we note its absence in addition to the more conventional negative side (fear from the negative prospect of losing something necessary for survival).\nBuilding the DocuScope dictionary for noun phrases has consisted of daily focused experiments in studying the dynamics of salience between modifiers and heads. Sometimes the head nouns control salience. Sometimes the modifiers. And in many cases, neither the modifier nor the head captures the salience exactly as a human reader would assign it. These latter cases require refining the dictionary substructure further and it is through these cases that the dictionary has systematically refined over the years, deepening in internal complexity within its original perimeters.\nOur assignment of salience for word classes other than noun phrases is rooted in adjectives. Take the root adjective “inscrutable.” In DocuScope’s repository, it is classified under inquiry with a negative sentiment. The inquiry category includes curiosity and methodical efforts to satisfy it. These efforts are positive when knowledge is achieved, when the matter under investigation is proven “scrutable” (knowable). “Inscrutable” (the vastly more popular antonym – appearing 891 times in COCA (as of February 2022) compared to only 7 occurrences of “scrutable”) suggests that the comprehension required for knowledge has been blocked, imposing a shield of mystery or opacity on the matter under scrutiny. These considerations create an impression that the adjective “inscrutable” is a reliable writer’s resource for signaling limits on comprehension. But just how robust is that impression? To what extent does it depend on the grammatical form, function, and overall embedding of “inscrutable” (and cognates) within a sentence in addition to the contextual motivations a writer or speaker may be seeking to satisfy by circulating it? And how does this impression, even if robust, differ from similar impressions designed to convey limited or obstructed comprehension?\nTo try to answer these questions, we routinely run adjectives like “inscrutable” through a battery of patterns (Table 2) to uncover collisions (now also understood as potential “anomalies”) with our initial classification as a way of stress testing and refining further that classification. As Table 2 indicates, beyond the root adjective, we use corpus data to explore the adverbs that can modify the adjective (e.g. “emotionally inscrutable”), that frame it as an adjective predicated before a BE verb (e.g., “be inscrutable”), that nominalize it (e.g. “inscrutability”), that make the nominalization a head noun (e.g., “chronic inscrutability”), that casts the nominalized form as the object of a verb (e.g. “heightened their inscrutability”), that changes the part of speech to an adverb (e.g. “inscrutably”), and that investigates the adverb both as a left modifier to adjectives (e.g., “inscrutably calm”), verbs (e.g. “inscrutably contacted”), and adverbs (e.g., “inscrutably so”) and a right modifier to adverbs (e.g. “quite inscrutably”) and verbs (e.g. “smiling inscrutably”).\nTable 2. Patterns we explore for collisions rooted in the adjective “inscrutable”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPattern examined for collisions\nExamples of each pattern\n\n\n\n\nRoot Adjective: Inscrutable\ninscrutable\n\n\nInscrutable Adverb Modifier\nemotionally inscrutable\n\n\nInscrutable Be\nbe inscrutable\n\n\nInscrutable/Inscrutability\ninscrutability\n\n\nInscrutable/Inscrutability/Head Noun\nchronic inscrutability\n\n\nInscrutable/Inscrutability/Verb Fronting\nheightened their inscrutability\n\n\nInscrutable/Inscrutably\ninscrutably\n\n\nInscrutable/Inscrutably/Adverb Modifier Left\ninscrutably calm/contacted/so\n\n\nInscrutable/Inscrutably/Adverb Modifier Right\nquite/smiling inscrutably\n\n\n\nShould our initial classification of “inscrutable” (as blocked comprehension) prove relatively robust, most of the thousands of patterns uncovered through these various tests will roughly, if not precisely, remain consistent with the association of “inscrutable” with that classification. But even if this general robustness is confirmed, these tests invariably uncover many unforeseen recessive patterns that can recommend a salience shift away from blocked comprehension to an entirely different category placement in the repository. Should we want to describe Mona Lisa’s “inscrutable smile”, we may rightly want to keep the salience on the [descriptive] “smile” and De Vinci’s consummate artistic ability to render a woman who can’t be read. Should we want to describe an image’s “inscrutable elegance”, we may want to focus on the [positive value] “elegance” more than on the inability to explain its provenance.\nTests for recessive patterns also help us situate how the blocked comprehension of “inscrutable” differs from the blocked comprehension signaled by many synonyms, such as “baffled”, “befuddled”, “bewildered”, “circuitous, “complicated”, ’confounded”, “confused”, “convoluted”, “enigmatic”, “mystifying/mystified”, “puzzled”, “stumped”, and “stymied.” Applying these tests to “inscrutable” revealed that it can be used to modify the noun “face”. One can also show a “baffled”, “befuddled”, “bewildered”, “confused,” or “mystified” face. But it is more common to precede the latter adjectives with the verb “look” (e.g. they looked baffled/befuddled/bewildered/confused/mystified). There is, however, no “looking inscrutable.”\nThis last inconsistency can be explained by the fact that “inscrutable” references the blocked comprehension of the observer, not necessarily of the observed. There are three occurrences in COCA of an “inscrutable God”. But no writers included in COCA reference a “baffled/bewildered/befuddled/confused/mystified” God. These facts lend “inscrutable” a connection to spiritual, mystical, and religious contexts not shared by other composing patterns conveying blocked comprehension. “Inscrutable” is also perfectly suited to hone in on the specific failure to read the minds of others. “Inscrutable” carries salience in narratives of early courting relationships where potential partners struggle to understand the feelings of the other. The mutually-experienced “inscrutability” hallmarks the insecurity and immaturity of the early relationship. These small differences between “inscrutable” and its synonyms have large implications in how patterns conveying blocked comprehension distribute across the categories of the DocuScope dictionary.",

    "text": "3. Recent developments: Collocating composing patterns and topical structure\nDuring our years developing DocuScope, we were keenly aware that the statistical techniques (primarily Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis) we had used to analyze corpora did not work for single texts. Yet, we have always been interested in using DocuScope to support student writers who write a single text at a time. Our recent refinements in DocuScope responds to this desire to support the analysis of single text. It had emerged when we discovered a way to integrate it with another project, which we had recently taken up independently, to develop an interactive visualization tool to help writing students and analysts track the topical progression within a single text.\nThe notion of topicality and topical progression within a sentence was first addressed in the Prague School of Functional Linguistics by its 20th century founder Mathesius (Nekula, 1999) and elaborated by Firbas (1992) in his framework “Functional Sentence Perspective” (FSP) and Halliday (1967, 1968), Halliday & Hasan, (1976), and Halliday and Matthiessen, (2014) in their framework “Systemic Functional Linguistics” (SFL). In both these frameworks, the sentence segments that are most salient (designed to capture disproportionate reader attention) are distributed between a sentence’s launching points (sometimes called “theme”) and landing points (sometimes called “rheme”). Firbas thought of the launch/landing divide within a sentence as a continuous gradient rather than a binary. He allowed that any region of a sentence exhibited varying degrees of “communicative dynamism” with unfamiliar words exhibiting higher gradients of dynamism and familiar words lower gradients.\nDaneš (1970, 1974) extended the FSP framework to cover sentence to sentence transitions in paragraphs. He posited “thematic structures” (aka, “topical structures”) or the progression of themes/topics throughout a paragraph to track shifts in salience, that is to say, shifts in how the reader’s attention was being managed sentence-by-sentence. Daneš’ work on paragraphs was picked up by scholars in ESL/EFL (e.g., Connor, 1990; Hawes, 2015; Shabana, 2018) and rhetoric and composition (Williams, 1980, 2000; Faigley & Witte, 1983; Witte, 1983a, 1983b; Vande Kopple, 1989), whose primary takeaway was that a students’ ability to achieve paragraph coherence depended to a large extent on their ability to keep a single topic in focus across multiple sentences.\nBeyond this literature, we needed to represent topicality and topical progression across paragraphs, at the section or whole text level. Leong (2015, 2016, 2019) provided some precedent for this by hand-coding academic journal articles sentence-by-sentence and then using spreadsheets to display each topic as a cell that could be interpreted as meaningful at the section and the whole text level when viewed holistically. Inspired by Leong’s general approach, we created an interactive visualization environment, called OnTopic, which allows analysts to inspect the topical progression text at different levels of granularity (Ishizaki & Kaufer, 2020; forthcoming). After working on OnTopic for a while and running workshops to interested students and faculty, we discovered that they caught on to the value of the visualization of topical organization in their text. They had learned about paragraph progression (i.e., organization) and topics (at least topic sentences) in high school and they found the idea of a tool that could automatically track their main topics (aka themes) within and across paragraphs both intriguing and valuable. Their positive response, bred to some extent from familiarity, gave us an idea as to how we could piggy-back the DocuScope dictionary on top of OnTopic to benefit analysts or writers focused on single text interpretation or production respectively. We would allow analysts or draft writers to start with the major topics of a text and let them focus on the DocuScope categories proximate to (viz., in collocation with) these topics.\nThe collocation of topical categories and DocuScope categories had two expected benefits for analysts and students. First, it would let them focus on a few specific DocuScope categories at a time rather than master the whole repository, which can be overwhelming for students. Second, it would provide a more familiar and focused angle for interpreting the DocuScope categories because they would be anchored to the major themes analysts and students already knew and were already focusing on as researchers or writers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: A snapshot of major topics in King’s “I Have A Dream” Speech. Topics appear on the left and in order of appearance from the beginning to the end of the text.\n\n\n\nOur efforts at integrating DocuScope and topical analysis for single texts resulted in a new DocuScope tool, called DocuScope Write & Audit. The tool was designed for writing educators and students as well as for analysts interested in single texts. In her chapter in this volume, Cheryl Geisler discusses DocuScope Write & Audit as a tool for writing education. We briefly describe it here as a tool for rhetorical analysis. Figure 2.1 is a snapshot of Martin Luther King’s “I Have A Dream” speech in Write & Audit. The transcript of the speech was taken from the American Rhetoric website (King, 1963). All single sentences in sequence were combined into one paragraph. All paragraphs had a minimum of two sentences. If short two-sentence paragraphs followed one another and they maintained the same theme, they were combined into one paragraph.\nNotice the words in the leftmost column. They indicate the major topics in King’s speech in order of appearance: “year”, “Negro”, “today”, “nation”, “freedom”, America”, “justice”, “day”, “Alabama”, “faith”, “God”, and “land.” How did DocuScope select these words as topics? The tool offers various options for making this selection. The option we chose is to have DocuScope display words in King’s text that recur in at least two different paragraphs and that recur at least twice within one paragraph. Should we think that “nation” and “land” are redundant, we can combine them into one topic. At one point, King mentions “freedom and equality”. Should we want to add this phrase as a multi-word topic, DocuScope lets us do that as well. In sum, the left-hand column lets us filter down to the major concepts King references in his speech.\nNow let us turn to Figure 2, where we can explore how King collocates rhetorical patterns around his topic word “freedom”. The rows across consist of paragraph numbers. Columns under each paragraph number indicate the appearance (circle) or absence (blank) of the particular topic in the particular paragraph. A dark circle indicates that the topic word appears in that paragraph at least once prior to the main verb, typically in a subject slot. A white circle indicates that the topic word appears in that paragraph only after the main verb, as an entity elaborating the subject but not itself being elaborated. A circle (dark or white) with a dot on its left shoulder indicates that the topic word appears in the first sentence (the so-called “topic sentence”) of the paragraph.\nThe big takeaway from Figure 2 is the crescendo effect of King’s speech in the second to last paragraph (paragraph 14) relative to the topic of freedom and the rhetorical patterns of “positive” and “description”. This spike owes largely to the fact that in this paragraph King repeats the phrase “let freedom ring” eight times. Whereas “freedom” functions as a topic of the speech, it also functions as a rhetorical pattern signaling positive values. Whereas the verb “ring” has no standing as a topic, it nonetheless functions as a descriptive pattern. And so the choral repetition of “let freedom ring” in paragraph 14 causes a parallel spike in topical content and rhetorical effect. In every other paragraph of the speech, there are one to three positive patterns and one or two descriptive patterns. In paragraph 14, there are 11 positive patterns and 16 descriptive patterns. Prior to paragraph 14, King had positioned “freedom” in a preverbal subject slot (dark circle) only once before, in paragraph 7, when he observed that the “freedom (of whites) “is inextricably bound to” the “freedom” (of African-Americans). Not until paragraph 14 does King elevate “freedom” to a thematic topic of the entire speech. In concluding paragraph 15, King repositions “freedom” in a preverbal subject slot (“When we allow freedom ring”) before invoking the chant of the old spiritual, “Free at last”.\n\n\n\nA snapshot of major topics in King’s “I Have A Dream” Speech collocated with DocuScope composing patterns. The topic word “freedom” is being tracked for its collocations with the rhetorical patterns: “information”, “positive”, and “description”. Note that all three rhetorical patterns spike in the 14th and (to a lesser extent) 15th paragraphs, where King’s rhetoric, at least on these patterns, becomes especially concentrated.",

    "text": "4. Conclusion: The value of small milestones and future prospects\nThroughout its history, the DocuScope project has oscillated between a focus in education and textual research. We began by focusing on achieving short-term goals, but later realized that setting and meeting small milestones led to new goals, priorities, and phases. When we first started developing the dictionary, we thought we were helping to improve a single writing course. As the categories of the dictionary grew, we realized we could not manage them without statistical help to reduce the dimensionality. Once we instrumented our findings with statistics, we found we could gather useful insights about text collections beyond the scope of education. This led to a significant period when we thought our approach to language would benefit rhetorical and textual researchers more than educators.\nBut as we tried to make the dictionaries larger (high coverage) and more precise (increased accuracy) for researchers, we also (re)discovered the prospect of making DocuScope more useful as an educational tool. This realization in turn began a new phase of experimenting with educational and research environments focused on the single text and the desirability of studying collocates of topical structure and rhetorical patterns as we saw in the King example. Students, after all, write one text at a time, and single texts are incredibly small targets from which to extract accurate evidence for meaningful feedback.\nWhile we never imagined the dictionary becoming perfect or complete, we did envision it becoming mature. Mature meant that the way the dictionaries factor inventional contexts and link invention to expression would be a reliable and shared public resource for textual and educational research as well as for writing education. Signals that we have reached maturity with the dictionaries is evident in the way we now think about collisions. Collisions refer to the fact that expanding the dictionaries invariably involves breaking them, discovering that a unique expression has been assigned more than one inventional category. From the beginning of the project, we relied on automatic collision detectors to detect collisions and assist in their resolution. But the way we use collision detection has dramatically changed over time. In the first decade of the project, we thought of collisions as unanticipated “mistakes” in our thinking that required us to repair the categories and category hierarchies. In the second decade of the project, as the categories and hierarchies grew and refined, collisions have increasingly become planned “experiments” that we actively apply to stress-test the categories and explore increasing granular avenues of refinement.\nIn retrospect, we believe we have come a long way since 1998, when our theory of rhetorical production tying invention to expression was schematically envisioned but implicit. The development of the DocuScope dictionaries, as an approximation of our theory, has conferred to the theory a degree of explicitness and tangibility necessary for others to learn from, build on, and continue to refine.",
