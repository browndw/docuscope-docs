The **Tag Frequencies** page lets you view, filter, and visualize how often different linguistic tags appear in your corpus. You can also download the results for further analysis.

## What You Can Do

- Generate a tag frequency table for your loaded corpus
- Choose between Parts-of-Speech (POS) tags or DocuScope tags
- Filter the table to focus on specific tags
- View the data as a table or as a bar plot
- Download the table as an Excel file

## Step 1: Generate a Tag Frequency Table

If you haven’t already generated a tag frequency table, you’ll see a prompt to do so.

- Click the **Tags Table** button in the sidebar.
- Wait for processing to complete. If you see a warning, check that you have loaded a target corpus.

**What is a "tag"?**  
A *tag* is a label assigned to each token in your text, such as a part-of-speech (noun, verb, etc.) or a DocuScope rhetorical category. Tag frequency tables show how often each tag appears in your documents.

## Step 2: Choose a Tagset

Once your tag frequency table is ready, use the sidebar to select which tags to display:

- **Parts-of-Speech**: Shows grammatical categories.
  - Choose between *General* (broad categories) or *Specific* (detailed tags).
- **DocuScope**: Shows rhetorical or functional categories from the DocuScope system.

---

## Step 3: Filter and Explore

- Use the **Select tags to filter** box to focus on specific tags of interest.
- The table updates automatically to show only the tags you select.

---

## Step 4: Table and Plot Views

- Use the **Table** tab to view the frequency data in tabular form.
- Use the **Plot** tab to see a bar chart of tag frequencies.

**Tip:**  
Visualizing tag frequencies can help you quickly spot patterns or differences between categories in your corpus.

## Step 5: Download Your Table

- Use the **Excel** button in the sidebar to download the current table as an Excel file.
- You can open this file in spreadsheet software for further analysis or sharing.

---

## Understanding the Table

- Use the **Column explanation** expander in the sidebar for definitions of each column.
- Columns typically include the tag, its frequency, and possibly its percentage of the total.
