{{< iconify material-symbols:construction >}} Under construction.

The **N-gram and Cluster Frequency** page lets you explore common word/tag sequences (n-grams) and search for clusters containing specific words or tags in your corpus.

---

## What You Can Do

- Generate frequency tables for n-grams (sequences of 2, 3, or 4 tags)
- Search for clusters containing a specific word or tag
- Filter n-grams by tag at each position
- Download your results as an Excel file

---

## Step 1: Choose Table Type

When you first visit the page, you’ll be asked:

- **N-grams**: Find the most frequent sequences of tags (e.g., POS or DocuScope tags).
- **Clusters**: Find all n-grams that contain a specific word or tag at a chosen position.

**What is an "n-gram"?**  
An *n-gram* is a sequence of n items (words or tags) that appear together in your text. For example, a 3-gram (trigram) could be "in the house" or "NOUN VERB NOUN".

## Step 2: Set Your Options

### For N-grams

- **Span**: Choose the length (2, 3, or 4).
- **Tagset**: Choose between Parts-of-Speech or DocuScope tags.
- Click **N-grams Table** to generate the table.

### For Clusters

- **Search mode**: Choose to search by a specific token (word) or tag.
- **Node word/tag**: Enter the word or select the tag you want to anchor your search.
- **Search type** (for tokens): Choose Fixed, Starts with, Ends with, or Contains.
- **Tagset**: Choose Parts-of-Speech or DocuScope.
- **Span & position**: Choose the n-gram length and the position of your anchor.
- Click **Clusters Table** to generate the table.

---

## Step 3: Filter and Explore

- Once your table is generated, use the filters at the top to focus on specific tags at each position in the n-gram.
- The table updates automatically as you filter.

**Tip:**  
Filtering by tag position helps you find patterns, like all trigrams starting with a verb or ending with a specific rhetorical tag.

## Step 4: Download Your Table

- Toggle **Download to Excel?** in the sidebar to enable download.
- Click **Download to Excel** to save your results for further analysis.

---

## Generating a New Table

- Use the **Create a New Ngrams Table** button in the sidebar to reset and start over with new settings.

---

## Tips for New Users

::: {.callout-tip}
- Try generating both n-gram and cluster tables to see which is most useful for your research.
- If you don’t see any data, make sure you have loaded and processed a target corpus.
- Download your results often so you can experiment without losing your work.

## If You Get Stuck

::: {.callout-important}
- Use the **reset** button on the Manage Corpus Data page if you need to start over.
- If you see warnings, check that your corpus is loaded and processed, and that your search settings are valid.
