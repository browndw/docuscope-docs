The **Download Tagged Files** page lets you export your processed corpus as a zipped folder of plain text files, each with embedded linguistic tags. This is useful for sharing, annotation, or further analysis in other tools.

---

## What You Can Do

- Download your **target** corpus as individual text files, each with embedded tags
- Choose which tagset to embed: **Parts-of-Speech** or **DocuScope**
- Download all files as a single ZIP archive

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Choose Tagset to Embed

- In the sidebar, select either **Parts-of-Speech** or **DocuScope** as the tagset to embed in your files.
- Parts-of-Speech tags show grammatical categories (like NOUN, VERB).
- DocuScope tags show rhetorical or functional categories.

### 2. Download the ZIP Archive

- Once you’ve selected a tagset, click **Download to Zip** in the sidebar.
- This will download a zipped folder containing one tagged text file for each document in your corpus.

::: {.callout-important}
Each file contains your original text with tags embedded, making it easy to see how each word or phrase was analyzed.
:::

In the generated text files, the tags are embbedd after a vertical bar:

```{.js}
At|II root|NN1 , every|AT1 hypothesis|NN1 is|VBZ a|AT1 claim|NN1 about|II the|AT relevance|NN1
```

Because the tags identify mutliword units, spaces that occur within a token are replaced with underscores:

```{.js}
evidence|Reasoning and|SyntacticComplexity theory|AcademicTerms pertaining_to_the|Reasoning possibility_of|ConfidenceHedged sympatric|Description speciation|Description
```

If you are planning to use the output to process the files in a tool like [AntConc](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/){target="_blank"} or in a coding environment, take note of these conventions and account for them accordingly.
