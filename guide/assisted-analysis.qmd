The **AI-Assisted Analysis** page lets you ask questions about your data in plain English. Powered by PandasAI, this tool is designed for one-off, natural language queries about your data tables—making it easy to get summaries, statistics, and insights without writing code.

---

## What You Can Do

- Select a data table from your corpus (Target, Reference, Keywords, or Grouped)
- Preview and optionally pivot or normalize your data
- Ask questions about your data in natural language (e.g., "What is the average frequency of nouns?")
- Get answers as text, tables, or simple plots
- Download results (including plots as PNG images)
- Clear your chat history and start a new query

---

## How It Works

::: {.callout-important}
Pandabot uses AI to turn your question into Python code, runs it on your selected data, and returns the result. Each prompt is handled as a single, independent query—there is no iterative conversation or memory of previous prompts.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Select Data

- Use the **Select corpus** radio buttons to choose which data to analyze (Target, Reference, Keywords, or Grouped).
- Use the **Select data to analyze** dropdown to pick a specific table (e.g., tag frequencies, document-term matrix).
- Preview your data in the main panel. You can toggle **Pivot Table** or **Make Percent** to adjust the format.

### 2. Ask a Question

- Enter your question in the chat input at the bottom. For example:
  - "Show the top 10 most frequent tags."
  - "What is the mean frequency of verbs by group?"
  - "List all documents where noun frequency is above 5%."
- Pandabot will generate the code, run it, and display the result as a table, number, text, or plot.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Tip:**  
You can ask for summaries, group comparisons, filtering, or even simple visualizations. For more advanced or iterative plotting, use the **AI-Assisted Plotting** tool instead.
:::

### 3. Download Results

- If your result is a plot, you can download it as a PNG image.
- Tables and text results can be copied for further use.

### 4. Manage API Keys and Quotas

- If you’re using the community API, you have a daily quota of queries. The sidebar shows your usage and remaining queries.
- If you run out, or want to use your own OpenAI API key, enter it in the sidebar.

### 5. Clear Chat History

- Use the **Clear Pandabot History** button in the sidebar to start a new query. This removes all previous messages.

## Tips for New Users

::: {.callout-tip}
- Start with simple questions: "Show all tags," "What is the average frequency of adjectives?"
- For more complex visualizations or iterative refinement, use the **AI-Assisted Plotting** tool.
- Download or copy your results for use in reports or further analysis.

## If You Get Stuck

::: {.callout-important}
- Make sure you have loaded and processed a target corpus.
- If you see warnings about data, check your table selection.
- If you run out of community API queries, enter your own OpenAI API key.
- Use the **reset** button on the Manage Corpus Data page if you need to start over.
