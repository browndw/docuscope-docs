The **KWIC** page helps you find and examine every occurrence of a word (the "node word") in your corpus, along with the words that appear immediately before and after it. This is a classic tool for exploring how words are used in different contexts.

## What is KWIC?

::: {.callout-important}
A **KWIC table** (Key Word in Context) shows each instance of a search word in your corpus, with a window of surrounding words on either side. This lets you quickly see patterns, collocations, and typical uses.
:::

---

## What You Can Do

- Search for a node word and see every occurrence in your corpus, with context
- Choose how to match the node word (exact, starts with, ends with, contains)
- Make your search case sensitive or insensitive
- Download the KWIC table as an Excel file
- Create new KWIC tables for different node words

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Enter a Node Word

- In the sidebar, enter the word you want to search for (the "node word").
- The search will find all instances of this word in your corpus.

### 2. Choose Search Mode

- **Fixed:** Exact match (e.g., "run" finds only "run").
- **Starts with:** Finds words that start with your node word (e.g., "run" finds "running", "runner").
- **Ends with:** Finds words that end with your node word (e.g., "ing" finds "running", "sing").
- **Contains:** Finds words that contain your node word anywhere.

### 3. Case Sensitivity

- Use the checkbox to make your search case sensitive (e.g., "Run" vs "run").

### 4. Generate the KWIC Table

- Click the **KWIC** button to generate your table.
- If your corpus is not loaded, youâ€™ll see a warning.

### 5. View and Download Results

- The KWIC table will display all matches, with the node word centered and context on either side.
- Use the **Download to Excel?** toggle in the sidebar to enable download.
- Click **Download to Excel** to save your results.

### 6. Create a New KWIC Table

- Use the **Create New KWIC Table** button in the sidebar to reset and search for a different node word.

---

## Understanding the Table

- Each row shows a match for your node word, with columns for the left context, the node word, and the right context.
- This format makes it easy to spot patterns in how the word is used.

---

## Tips for New Users

::: {.callout-tip}
- Try searching for both common and rare words to see how their contexts differ.
- Use "starts with" or "ends with" to explore word families or morphological patterns.
- Download your results often so you can experiment without losing your work.

## If You Get Stuck

::: {.callout-important}
- Make sure you have loaded and processed a target corpus.
- If you see warnings, check your node word and search settings.
- Use the **reset** button on the Manage Corpus Data page if you need to start over.
