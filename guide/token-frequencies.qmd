{{< iconify material-symbols:construction >}} Under construction.

The **Token Frequencies** page lets you view, filter, and download tables showing how often different linguistic features (tokens) appear in your corpus.

---

## What You Can Do

- Generate a frequency table for your loaded corpus
- Choose between Parts-of-Speech (POS) tags or DocuScope tags
- Filter the table to focus on specific tags
- Download the table as an Excel file for further analysis

---

## Step 1: Generate a Frequency Table

If you haven’t already generated a frequency table, you’ll see a prompt to do so.

- Click the **Frequency Table** button in the sidebar.
- Wait for processing to complete. If you see a warning, check that you have loaded a target corpus.

**What is a "token"?**  
A *token* is usually a word or punctuation mark in your text. The app counts how many times each token (or tag) appears in your documents.

## Step 2: Choose a Tagset

Once your frequency table is ready, use the sidebar to select which tags to display:

- **Parts-of-Speech**: Shows grammatical categories (like nouns, verbs, adjectives).
  - Choose between *General* (broad categories) or *Specific* (detailed tags).
- **DocuScope**: Shows rhetorical or functional categories from the DocuScope system.

---

## Step 3: Filter and Explore

- Use the **Select tags to filter** box to focus on specific tags of interest.
- The table updates automatically to show only the tags you select.

**Tip:**  
Filtering helps you focus on just the features you care about—like seeing only verbs, or only DocuScope tags related to argumentation.

## Step 4: Download Your Table

- Use the **Excel** button in the sidebar to download the current table as an Excel file.
- You can open this file in spreadsheet software for further analysis or sharing.

---

## Understanding the Table

- Use the **Column explanation** expander in the sidebar for definitions of each column.
- Columns typically include the tag, its frequency, and possibly its percentage of the total.

## Tips for New Users

::: {.callout-tip}
- If you don’t see any data, make sure you have loaded and processed a target corpus.
- Try both tagsets (POS and DocuScope) to see which is most useful for your project.
- Download your results often so you can experiment without losing your work.

## If You Get Stuck
