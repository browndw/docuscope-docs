The **AI-Assisted Plotting** page lets you create custom visualizations by describing what you want to see in plain English. The built-in Plotbot (powered by ChatGPT) generates Python code to create your plot, and you can iteratively refine your request through chat.

## What You Can Do

- Select a data table from your corpus (target, reference, keywords, or grouped)
- Preview and optionally pivot or normalize your data
- Choose a plotting library (Plotly Express, Matplotlib, or Seaborn)
- Describe the plot you want in natural language
- View, download, and iteratively refine your plot through chat
- Download plots as PNG images

## How It Works

::: {.callout-important}
Plotbot uses AI to turn your text prompts into Python code for plotting. Each time you send a message, Plotbot generates or updates the code and shows you the result. You can keep chatting to refine your plot until it looks just right.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Select Data

- Use the **Select corpus** radio buttons to choose which data to plot (Target, Reference, Keywords, or Grouped).
- Use the **Select data to plot** dropdown to pick a specific table (e.g., tag frequencies, document-term matrix).
- Preview your data in the main panel. You can toggle **Pivot Table** or **Make Percent** to adjust the format.

### 2. Choose a Plotting Library

- Select from **plotly.express**, **matplotlib**, or **seaborn**.
- The library you choose will affect the style and features of your plot.

### 3. Describe Your Plot

- Use the chat input at the bottom to describe the plot you want. For example:
  - "Show a bar chart of the top 10 tags."
  - "Plot a scatterplot of noun vs. verb frequency, colored by group."
  - "Make a boxplot comparing tag frequencies across categories."
- Plotbot will generate the code, run it, and display the plot.

### 4. Refine Your Plot

- If you want to change something, just describe the update in the chat. For example:
  - "Change the color scheme."
  - "Add axis labels."
  - "Show only documents from group A."
- Plotbot remembers your previous messages and builds on them, so you can iterate until you’re satisfied.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Tip:**  
Be as specific as you like! You can ask for titles, legends, color changes, or even new plot types. If Plotbot doesn’t get it right, clarify your request or start over.
:::

### 5. Download Your Plot

- Each plot is shown as a static PNG image.
- Use the **Download PNG** link below the plot to save it.

### 6. Manage API Keys and Quotas

- If you’re using the community API, you have a daily quota of queries. The sidebar shows your usage and remaining queries.
- If you run out, or want to use your own OpenAI API key, enter it in the sidebar.

### 7. Clear Chat History

- Use the **Clear chat history** button in the sidebar to start a new conversation with Plotbot. This can help if your thread gets off track.

## Tips for New Users

::: {.callout-tip}
- Start simple: "Show a bar chart of tag frequencies."
- Refine step by step: "Now color by group," "Add a title," etc.
- If you get an error or the plot isn’t what you expected, rephrase your request or clear the chat history.
- Download your plots to include in reports or presentations.

## If You Get Stuck

::: {.callout-important}
- Make sure you have loaded and processed a target corpus.
- If you see warnings about data, check your table selection.
- If you run out of community API queries, enter your own OpenAI API key.
- Use the **reset** button on the Manage Corpus Data page if you need to start over.
