{{< iconify material-symbols:construction >}} Under construction.


The **Collocates** page helps you find words or tags that frequently appear near a chosen "node word" in your corpus. This is a powerful way to explore patterns of association and meaning.

## What is a Collocation?

::: {.callout-important}
A **collocation** is a pair or group of words (or tags) that tend to appear together more often than would be expected by chance. For example, "strong tea" and "make a decision" are common collocations in English.

## What You Can Do

- Search for words or tags that frequently occur near a chosen node word
- Set the span (window) to the left and right of the node word
- Filter results by tag
- Choose the association statistic (NPMI, PMI, PMI2, PMI3)
- Download your results as an Excel file

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Enter a Node Word

- In the sidebar, enter the word you want to explore (the "node word").
- You can optionally anchor your search to a specific tag (POS or DocuScope) for the node word.

### 2. Set the Span

- Choose how many words to the left and right of the node word to include in your search window.

### 3. Choose an Association Statistic

- **PMI (Pointwise Mutual Information):** Measures how much more often two words appear together than would be expected by chance. It is very sensitive to rare co-occurrences, which can sometimes highlight spurious associations.
- **PMI2 / PMI3:** Variations of PMI that are *less* sensitive to rare co-occurrences. These provide more stable results by reducing the influence of very infrequent pairs.
- **NPMI (Normalized PMI):** Scales PMI between -1 and 1, making it easier to compare across different word pairs and reducing the impact of rare events.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Tip:**  
If you want to avoid results dominated by rare word pairs, try PMI2, PMI3, or NPMI instead of standard PMI.
:::

### 4. (Optional) Anchor by Tag

- You can restrict your search to node words with a specific POS or DocuScope tag.
- For POS, you can choose between general or specific tags.

### 5. Generate and Filter Results

- Click the **Collocations** button to generate your table.
- Filter the results by tag using the multiselect box above the table.

### 6. Download Your Results

- Toggle **Download to Excel?** in the sidebar to enable download.
- Click **Download to Excel** to save your results.

### 7. Create a New Collocations Table

- Use the **Create New Collocations Table** button in the sidebar to reset and start a new search.

---

## Understanding the Table

- Each row shows a collocate (word or tag), its frequency, and the chosen association statistic.
- Higher values indicate a stronger association with the node word.

---

## Tips for New Users

::: {.callout-tip}
- Try different statistics to see which gives the most meaningful results for your data.
- If you get unexpected results, try narrowing the span or anchoring by tag.
- Download your results often so you can experiment without losing your work.

## If You Get Stuck

::: {.callout-important}
- Make sure you have loaded and processed a target corpus.
- If you see warnings, check your node word and tag selections.
- Use the **reset** button on the Manage Corpus Data page if you need to start over.
