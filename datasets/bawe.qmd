## About the British Academic Written English Corpus

The **British Academic Written English (BAWE) Corpus** is a large-scale collection of proficient student writing from British universities. Created by Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner, BAWE offers insights into how successful students write across disciplines in the UK higher education system.

### What's in BAWE?

BAWE originally contains **2,761 assignments** representing:

- **Writing from 4 major discipline families**: Arts & Humanities, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences
- **35 different disciplines** including English, Biology, Engineering, Psychology, Business, and many more  
- **Students at 3 levels**: undergraduate years 1-3 and taught postgraduate
- **13 genre families** covering essays, reports, proposals, critiques, case studies, and more
- **High-quality writing**: All texts received grades of 60% or above (equivalent to B- or better)

### Why Use BAWE?

BAWE is particularly valuable because it shows:

- **British academic writing conventions** - how students write in the UK university system
- **Genre diversity** - the widest variety of assignment types of any student corpus
- **Disciplinary breadth** - comprehensive coverage across major academic fields
- **Systematic organization** - carefully classified by discipline, level, and genre
- **International perspective** - complements American corpora like MICUSP

### Available Versions in DocuScope

Due to BAWE's large size, both versions available have been strategically down-sampled:

| **Corpus Version** | **Sampling Method** | **Best For** |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **BAWE Mini** | Balanced across 4 discipline families | Quick exploration and balanced comparisons |
| **BAWE** | One random sample per contributing student | Comprehensive analysis with student diversity |

::: {.callout-important}
**Important Note:** Both BAWE versions in DocuScope are down-sampled from the original 2,761 texts. The full version contains one randomly selected text from each student contributor, while the mini version is further balanced across discipline families to roughly match the MICUSP Mini size.

### Research Questions You Can Explore

BAWE's systematic classification makes it ideal for investigating:

- **Cross-National Comparisons**: How does British student writing compare to American writing (using MICUSP)?
- **Genre Analysis**: How do essays differ from reports, proposals, or case studies?
- **Disciplinary Conventions**: What makes writing in Life Sciences different from Arts & Humanities?
- **Academic Level Progression**: How does writing change from first-year to postgraduate level?
- **Assignment Types**: Which disciplines favor certain genres (reports vs. essays)?

### BAWE's Genre Classification System

BAWE uses a sophisticated **13 genre families** system:

- **Explanation** (describing processes, concepts)
- **Exercise** (problem-solving, calculations)  
- **Narrative Recount** (describing events, experiences)
- **Empathy Writing** (creative, personal response)
- **Critique** (evaluating texts, arguments, theories)
- **Essay** (developing arguments, analysis)
- **Literature Survey** (reviewing research)
- **Methodology Recount** (describing research methods)
- **Case Study** (analyzing specific examples)
- **Problem Question** (addressing specific issues)
- **Proposal** (suggesting research, projects)
- **Research Report** (presenting original research)
- **Design Specification** (technical planning documents)

### Getting Started with BAWE

1. **Begin with BAWE Mini**: Start with the balanced sample to understand the corpus structure
2. **Explore Genre Families**: Use the genre classification to focus your research
3. **Compare Strategically**: Consider comparing with MICUSP for cross-national insights
4. **Consider Discipline Families**: Use the 4-way classification for broad comparisons
