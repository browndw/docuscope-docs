## About the Michigan Corpus of Upper-Level Student Papers

The **Michigan Corpus of Upper-level Student Papers (MICUSP)** is a specialized collection of effective student writing from the University of Michigan. This corpus provides a window into how advanced undergraduate and graduate students write across different academic disciplines.

### What's in MICUSP?

MICUSP contains **828 student papers** representing:

- **Writing from 16 different disciplines** including Biology, Economics, English, History, Philosophy, Psychology, and more
- **Papers from students at different levels**: upper-level undergraduates (juniors and seniors) and graduate students
- **Multiple paper types**: research papers, reports, argumentative essays, case studies, and proposals
- **High-quality writing**: All papers received grades of A- or better from instructors

### Why Use MICUSP?

This corpus is particularly valuable for students because it shows:

- **Real examples** of successful academic writing at the college level
- **Disciplinary differences** in how students write across fields like science, humanities, and social sciences  
- **Genre variations** - how different types of assignments (reports vs. essays) use language differently
- **Advanced academic language** patterns that can inform your own writing development

### Available Versions in DocuScope

MICUSP is available in several formats to suit different research needs:

| **Corpus Version** | **Size** | **Best For** |
|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| **MICUSP Mini** | Sample subset | Quick exploration and learning the tools |
| **Full MICUSP** | Complete corpus | Comprehensive analysis across disciplines |
| **MICUSP by Paper Type** | Organized by genres | Comparing different types of academic writing |
