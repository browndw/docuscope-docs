## DocuScope spaCy Models: Full vs. Common Dictionary

::: {.callout-important}
**DocuScope CA runs on a model.**  
When "dictionaries" are referenced, they refer to [the model training data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/browndw/docusco-spacy-training).  
The "Full Dictionary" model uses the complete set of DocuScope tags, while the "Common Dictionary" model uses a reduced, more general set.

## Model Overview

| Model Name | HuggingFace Link | Tagset | Description |
|------------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Full Dictionary** | [en_docusco_spacy](https://huggingface.co/browndw/en_docusco_spacy) | Full DocuScope tagset | Most detailed, includes all original DocuScope categories. |
| **Common Dictionary** | [en_docusco_spacy_cd](https://huggingface.co/browndw/en_docusco_spacy_cd) | Common DocuScope tagset | Simplified, focuses on the most frequent and general categories. |

Both models are trained on the **CLAWS7 part-of-speech tagset**.

## Tagset Differences

### Full Dictionary

- **Scope:** Contains the entire set of DocuScope tags, as used in the original dictionary-lookup technology.
- **Categories:** Includes fine-grained distinctions (e.g., *Citation Authorized* vs. *Citation Hedged*, *Confidence High* vs. *Confidence Low*), specialized academic moves, and nuanced rhetorical features.
- **Use Case:** Best for detailed rhetorical, genre, or discourse analysis where subtle distinctions matter.

### Common Dictionary

- **Scope:** Uses a reduced set of the most common and broadly applicable DocuScope tags.
- **Categories:** Focuses on general rhetorical and linguistic features, omitting some of the more specialized or rare categories.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for general text analysis, classroom use, or when interpretability and simplicity are priorities.

## Why Choose One Over the Other?

### Choose the **Full Dictionary** model if:

- You need **maximum detail** and want to capture subtle rhetorical or genre distinctions.
- Your research or teaching requires the **full range of DocuScope categories**.
- You are analyzing academic, professional, or highly structured texts.

### Choose the **Common Dictionary** model if:

- You want a **simpler, more interpretable output**.
- You are working with **general texts** or need results that are easier to explain to non-specialists.
- You are doing **exploratory analysis** or classroom demonstrations.

## Example: Tagset Comparison

| Tag (Full)              | Present in Common? | Description (abbreviated) |
|-------------------------|:------------------:|---------------------------|
| Academic Terms          | ✔️                 | Specialized terms         |
| Citation Authorized     | ❌                 | (Merged into Citation)    |
| Confidence High/Low     | ❌                 | (Generalized)             |
| Metadiscourse Cohesive  | ✔️                 | Cohesive markers          |
| Strategic               | ✔️                 | Strategy/goal language    |
| Updates                 | ❌                 | (Omitted)                 |

*The Common Dictionary omits or merges some specialized categories for clarity and ease of use.*
