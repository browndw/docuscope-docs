# Getting Started {.unnumbered}

**DocuScope Corpus Analysis & Concordancer (DocuScope CA)** is a powerful web-based tool that combines traditional corpus analysis with cutting-edge natural language processing to make sophisticated textual analysis accessible to students, researchers, and educators.

## What is DocuScope CA?

DocuScope CA is a **Streamlit-powered application** that integrates three key technologies:

- **spaCy NLP processing** with custom-trained models for both part-of-speech and rhetorical tagging
- **DocuScope rhetorical analysis** framework for understanding how language functions in context
- **OpenAI integration** for AI-assisted analysis and visualization

The tool enables users to analyze small to medium-sized corpora (collections of texts) to understand patterns in language use, discover rhetorical strategies, and explore linguistic variation across different types of writing.

## How DocuScope CA Compares to Other Tools

### Similar to Traditional Concordancers
Like popular tools such as **AntConc**, DocuScope CA provides:

- **Word frequency analysis** and statistical summaries
- **KWIC (Keywords in Context)** displays for examining word usage patterns
- **N-gram analysis** to identify common phrases and collocations
- **Corpus comparison** capabilities for contrasting different text collections
- **Downloadable results** for further analysis or reporting

### What Makes DocuScope CA Different

DocuScope CA goes beyond traditional concordancing by offering:

#### **Integrated Rhetorical Analysis**
- **DocuScope tagging** that identifies rhetorical functions (confidence, stance, organization, etc.)
- **Dual annotation system** providing both grammatical (POS) and rhetorical tags simultaneously
- **Functional language analysis** that reveals how language works rather than just what words appear

#### **AI-Powered Assistance**
- **Assisted plotting** with OpenAI helping generate and refine visualizations
- **Intelligent analysis** suggestions based on corpus patterns
- **Natural language queries** for exploring data

#### **Educational Focus**
- **Pre-loaded corpora** including MICUSP, BAWE, Elsevier, and HAP-E datasets
- **Guided workflows** designed for classroom and research use
- **Multiple analysis levels** from basic frequency counts to advanced rhetorical patterns

#### **Modern Web Interface**
- **No software installation** required - runs entirely in your web browser
- **Interactive visualizations** with Plotly integration
- **Session management** that preserves your work across analysis sessions
- **Real-time processing** with immediate results

## Key Analysis Capabilities

DocuScope CA offers **14 main analysis modules** organized into intuitive workflows:

### **Core Analysis Tools**
1. **Token Frequencies** - Word and phrase frequency analysis with filtering options
2. **Tag Frequencies** - Analysis of grammatical and rhetorical tag distributions
3. **N-grams** - Identification of common word sequences and phrases
4. **Collocations** - Statistical analysis of word associations and co-occurrences
5. **KWIC (Keywords in Context)** - Detailed examination of word usage in context

### **Comparative Analysis**
6. **Compare Corpora** - Statistical comparison between different text collections
7. **Compare Corpus Parts** - Analysis of variation within a single corpus

### **Advanced Features**
8. **Advanced Plotting** - Create custom visualizations and statistical graphics
9. **Single Document Analysis** - Deep dive into individual texts
10. **Assisted Plotting** - AI-powered visualization generation and refinement
11. **Assisted Analysis** - OpenAI-guided exploration of corpus patterns

### **Data Management**
12. **Download Corpus** - Export processed data for external analysis
13. **Download Tagged Files** - Save annotated texts with linguistic tags
14. **Manage Corpus Data** - Upload, process, and organize your text collections

## Getting Started: Your First Steps

### Step 1: Access the "Manage Corpus Data" Interface

The **"Manage Corpus Data"** page is your starting point for any analysis. This interface allows you to work with texts in several ways:

#### **Option A: Use Pre-loaded Corpora**
Start with ready-to-analyze datasets:
- **MICUSP** - High-quality student writing from University of Michigan
- **BAWE** - British academic writing across disciplines and levels
- **Elsevier** - Published academic articles across 20 scientific fields
- **HAP-E** - Human vs. AI writing comparisons

#### **Option B: Upload External Data**
Bring your own pre-processed corpus:
- Upload `.parquet` files from other corpus analysis tools
- Load previously processed DocuScope CA datasets
- Import data with existing annotations

#### **Option C: Process New Texts**
Upload and analyze your own collection:
- Upload multiple `.txt` files (essays, articles, documents)
- Choose between full DocuScope model or Common Dictionary tagging
- Let the system process and tag your texts automatically

### Step 2: Explore Your Data

Once your corpus is loaded:

1. **Start with Token Frequencies** to get familiar with your data's vocabulary
2. **Examine Tag Frequencies** to understand rhetorical and grammatical patterns  
3. **Use KWIC analysis** to see how key terms function in context
4. **Try corpus comparisons** if you have multiple datasets

### Step 3: Dive Deeper

As you become comfortable with the basics:

- **Experiment with N-grams** to find common phrases and expressions
- **Explore collocations** to understand word associations
- **Use advanced plotting** to create publication-ready visualizations
- **Try AI-assisted features** for guided analysis and insights

## Who Can Use DocuScope CA?

### **Students**
- Analyze your own writing for rhetorical effectiveness
- Compare your work to published examples in your field
- Understand disciplinary writing conventions
- Develop critical language awareness

### **Researchers**
- Conduct corpus-based studies of language variation
- Analyze rhetorical strategies across genres and contexts
- Compare human and AI-generated texts
- Investigate cross-cultural writing patterns

### **Educators**
- Demonstrate linguistic concepts with real data
- Create assignments using provided corpora
- Help students understand academic writing conventions
- Integrate corpus analysis into writing instruction

## Ready to Begin?

The best way to learn DocuScope CA is to start exploring. We recommend:

1. **Begin with a pre-loaded corpus** to familiarize yourself with the interface
2. **Follow the guided workflows** in our documentation
3. **Start simple** with basic frequency analysis before moving to advanced features
4. **Experiment freely** - the tool is designed for exploration and discovery
